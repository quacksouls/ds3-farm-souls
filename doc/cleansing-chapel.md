# Cleansing Chapel

Don't farm souls here. The majority of enemies are hollows and most of the
enemies outside in the graveyard are zombies who vomit maggots at you to bleed
you to death. There are 6 Cathedral Knights and 2 Cathedral Evangelists, but the
routes you must take to get to each one can be rather long. The zombies in the
graveyard seemingly continue to spawn indefinitely after being killed. As shown
in the video below, zombies won't spawn after killing a certain number of them.
Clearing the graveyard can be a long and tedious endeavour, but you would earn
approximately 24,418 souls.
