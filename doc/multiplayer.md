Finally, you can farm souls through invasion and jolly co-operation. As a gold
or white phantom, the amount of souls you would obtain is a percentage of what
your host would obtain. As a blue, purple, or red phantom the amount of souls
obtained is a percentage of how many souls were required for the target to reach
their current soul level. More details can be found here:

A quicker method is to ask another player to drop soul items for you. The host
can drop 7 stacks of 99 Souls of a Great Champion, 7 stacks of 99 Souls of a
Champion, 7 stacks of 99 Souls of a Venerable Old Hand, 7 stacks of 99 Souls of
an Old Hand, and 2 stacks of 99 Large Souls of a Seasoned Warrior. These come to
30 stacks, totalling 75,982,500 souls. Ask someone to drop these 30 stacks of
soul items and summon your red phantom. You can gain extra souls by killing the
host and equip all soul-boosting gears: Symbol of Avarice, Silver Serpent
Ring+3, Shield of Want, Mendicant's Staff. The effects of these soul-boosting
items stack with each other in a multiplicative manner to give you 100(1.50 x
1.35 x 1.20 x 1.20) = 291.6% extra souls. For maximum extra souls, the host
should be at SL802. A red phantom killing an SL802 host would obtain 1% of the
souls required for the host to level up from SL801 to SL802, i.e. the red
phantom would obtain 1% of 12,368,992 which is 123,689 souls. Equipping the
above soul-boosting items would yield 360,677 souls from killing an SL802 host.
The above method should provide you with a maximum of 76,343,177 souls per
round.
