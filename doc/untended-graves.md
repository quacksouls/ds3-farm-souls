# Untended Graves

This area is not ideal for farming souls. If you want to use the Warden
Twinblades, farm the 2 Grave Wardens in this area. Beware that a Grave Warden is
quick and can trigger bleed with her weapon. One effective way to deal with a
Grave Warden is to stun lock her with a fully charged R2 of an ultra greatsword
having a thrust R2. The Grave Wardens drop Large Titanite Shards and the hollows
drop Large Souls of a Deserted Corpse.

Starting from the Untended Graves bonfire, head to the Champion Gundyr boss
arena. On your way, you will first meet two Grave Wardens. Fight one at a time
and kill as quickly as possible before you are bled. Ignore all dogs and
continue to Champion Gundyr's boss room, killing all hollows on your way as well
as the hollows outside of his arena. In NG+0, while equipping the Silver Serpent
Ring+0, Shield of Want, and Symbol of Avarice, each round earns you
approximately 8,218 souls.
