To effectively farm souls, use these soul boosting items: Silver Serpent Ring+3,
Shield of Want, Mendicant's Staff, and Symbol of Avarice. Ask someone to drop
these items for you. You get bonus souls when you one-shot an enemy. Enemies
also drop items such as upgrade materials, weapons, soul items, consumables, and
their armour sets. These can be sold to the Shrine Handmaid for more souls in
addition to the souls you get from killing the enemies. Refer to the guide below
for how to obtain equipments necessary for farming:

Below are some strategies and routes for farming souls, including approximate
amounts you would get. Except for NG+0 and unless otherwise stated, the data
below were gathered while equipping the Silver Serpent Ring+3, Shield of Want,
Mendicant's Staff, and Symbol of Avarice. By the end of NG+0 after killing all
mimics, I didn't get the Symbol of Avarice so I didn't use it to gather the data
for NG+0. It was only after killing all mimics that I remembered the backup
trick for farming mimics. Overall, the Grand Archives and the Ringed City are
the best places for farming souls.
