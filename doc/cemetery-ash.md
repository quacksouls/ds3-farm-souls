# Cemetery of Ash

In NG+0, consider using this starting area to farm a small number of souls to
help you level up a bit before proceeding to the second area of the game. The
hollows drop Fading Souls. This route ignores the Sword Master because he does
not respawn after you defeated him the first time. At this point in the game,
you should have the Silver Serpent Ring+0.

From the Cemetery of Ash bonfire, kill every enemy on your way to the coffin
from which you spawned at the very beginning of the game. Then head to Firelink
Shrine, killing every enemy on your way and all enemies near Firelink Shrine.
Essentially, you are dispatching of all enemies around Firelink Shrine and
Cemetery of Ash. While equipping the Silver Serpent Ring+0, this route should
yield approximately 585 souls, enough to get a level or two before you head to
the High Wall of Lothric.

From NG+1 onward, you should be using a weapon capable of one-shotting each
enemy in Cemetery of Ash. Below are some data on the approximate amounts of
souls you would obtain if you use the above route for soul farming in various NG
cycles. The data were gathered while equipping the Silver Serpent Ring+3, Symbol
of Avarice, and Shield of Want. Each number within parentheses is the
approximate percentage increase from the previous NG cycle.

-   NG+0: 1,469
-   NG+1: 7,495 (510.2%)
