# Anor Londo

A quick route consists of farming the 3 Silver Knights outside of Aldrich's boss
arena. The Silver Knights in this area also drop (Large) Titanite Shards and
Proofs of a Concord Kept. Each Silver Knight is vulnerable to parry and riposte.
Equip a parrying shield or a Caestus, parry, and riposte with a Fire Dagger.
Another strategy is to lure a Silver Knight to the bridge of the circular
staircase. While standing on the middle of the bridge, the Silver Knight
wouldn't be able to enter the bridge. As the Silver Knight slowly retreats while
blocking with a shield, break his guard and riposte. While 2-handing a Raw
infused Claymore+6, 2 hits with R1 are sufficient to break the guard of a normal
Silver Knight and 2 ripostes are enough to kill him. With this weapon, you
require 3 hits with R1 to break the guard of the red-eyed Silver Knight and 2
ripostes and a fully charged R2 to kill him. In NG+0, while equipping the Silver
Serpent Ring+0, Shield of Want, and Symbol of Avarice, each round earns you
approximately 17,820 souls.
