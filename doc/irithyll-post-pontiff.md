# Irithyll of the Boreal Valley: post-Pontiff

The area after Pontiff Sulyvahn is an invasion hot spot. If you don't want to be
invaded while farming souls, consider playing offline while you're in the area.
Before you start farming, ensure you have dispatched of the 2 Drang Knights near
the 2 living giants who are resting among a bunch of giant corpses. Enemies in
this area drop (Large) Titanite Shards and covenant items. The deacons drop
Human Dregs and the Silver Knights drop Proofs of a Concord Kept.

For this area, I recommend you 2-hand a Raw infused Claymore+6. The single most
dangerous enemies in this area are the Silver Knights. Whenever you can, don't
fight a Silver Knight while standing on a buttress. Lure a Silver Knight to
level ground, get an R1 in, and move or roll away. While 2-handing a Raw infused
Claymore+6, two hits with R1 are sufficient to stagger each Silver Knight. The
deacons are less dangerous, but still pose a threat in large numbers. Each of
the 2 giants is slow and easy to kill if you constantly strafe around them.

Starting from the Pontiff Sulyvahn bonfire, make your way to the underpass that
has a group of Irithyllian Slaves. Kill them and move on to kill the deacons.
Next, fight one giant at a time. After you have dispatched of both giants, head
up the staircase and fight all 6 Silver Knights on or near the buttresses. In
NG+0, while equipping the Silver Serpent Ring+0, Shield of Want, and Symbol of
Avarice, each round yields approximately 57,420 souls.
