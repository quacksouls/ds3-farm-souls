# Dark Firelink Shrine

This area is not ideal for farming souls. However, the area has 4 Black Knights
for you to farm their armour set and weapons.

At this point in NG+0, you should have the Silver Serpent Ring+0, Shield of
Want, and Symbol of Avarice. Farm the 4 Black Knights after the Champion Gundyr
bonfire, outside of dark Firelink Shrine. Lure each Black Knight to the main
entrance of dark Firelink Shrine, stand inside the shrine, and the Black Knight
wouldn't be able to enter the shrine. Each Black Knight is very strong, so
cheese them if you want. Each round in NG+0 yields 15,840 souls.

Below are some data on the approximate amounts of souls you would obtain if you
use the above route for soul farming in various NG cycles. The data were
gathered while equipping the Silver Serpent Ring+3, Symbol of Avarice, and
Shield of Want.
